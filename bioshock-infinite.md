Graphics - looks incredible, but FOV being locked to ~80 without editing a config file is not a good look
Controls - absolutely horrible (specifically decreased mouse sensitivity while sprinting)
Story - about 90 minutes in, and feel like there has been absolutely nothing explained yet
Saving - HOW IS THERE NOT A WAY TO MANUALLY SAVE
